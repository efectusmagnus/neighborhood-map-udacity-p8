# Neighborhood Map - Udacity Project NÂ°8.

## Description

The aim of this project is a single page application that features a map of Paderborn's Museums. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and includes highlighted locations that are fetched from the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api), which are shown in a list of museums' names and can be searched through a filter input field. Such locations are shown in the custom Google map thanks to the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/). The Google map shows a custom infowindow with Foursquare data when a museum's marker or a museum's name is clicked.
